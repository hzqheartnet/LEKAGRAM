# **LEKAgram (inprogress)**

It is a combination of the Malay word ‚Äú _**LEKA**_ ‚Äú with the Instagram ‚Äú_**gram**_‚Äù.

**Definition of LEKA : Careless. (‚Äúblind‚Äù) Gram : Telegram**

# **The Main Focus ( Platform )**

_**Instagram**_:  was founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger in October 2010. The company operates independently of Facebook and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Instagram is an online social networking company that lets you share photos and videos with your followers. Keep reading to learn why it‚Äôs called Instagram. Not only can you share experiences with Instagram followers, but you can also, with just a single click, share images and videos to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Foursquare, Flickr and more. 

**Why is Instagram called Instagram?**

**_Instant Camera + Telegram = Instagram_**
The name Instagram is a portmanteau of ‚Äúinstant camera‚Äù and ‚Äútelegram.‚Äù Systrom wanted the name to be easy to pronounce, spell and follow the ‚Äúright here, right now‚Äù concept. Before Instagram, Systrom and Keigel received a $500K investment from Baseline Ventures and Andreesen Horowitz to grow their HMTL5 check-in app named Burbn. Not surprisingly, the app was named after Systrom‚Äôs interests for fine Whiskey‚Äôs and Bourbons. Unfortunately, after shipping the check-in app (similar concept to foursquare), Systrom and Kieger both felt the app was feature-heavy and complicated to use. They stepped back and aimed to simplify. After deconstructing the app, the only features that remained were photos, comments and likes.

## ***Obsession vs Passion**: 
-What is the nature of obsession? Where do we draw the line between passion and obsession? Is obsession a necessity for creativity and dedication or a mental disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, an obsession is ‚Äúrecurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance as intrusive and inappropriate, and that cause marked anxiety and distress.‚Äù (Greenberg, William M. (2013, Sept 23). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) 

-Moreover, ‚Äúthe person attempts to suppress or ignore such thoughts, impulses, or images or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.‚Äù (Greenberg, William M. (2013, Sept 23). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) 

-On the other hand, passion is ‚Äúan intense desire or enthusiasm for something; the zealous pursuit of an aim.‚Äù (Passion. (n.d.). In Oxford English Dictionary.) Thus, the key difference between an obsession and passion seems to be about control. While obsessive individuals are controlled by unwanted thoughts, passionate individuals make deliberate decisions based on their interests.
# **The Objective ( LEKAgram installation )**

To investigate the human behavior towards the social media such as Instagram and how and what are they addicted so much of using the application. The result of audience that participate with the installation will have better sight of themselves and how the Instagram "blind" them. 

# **The Outcome ( LEKAgram Layout )**
The outcome of the project will be the stage of **interactive installation** being play with the audience. 

There will be some obstacle appears while the audience interacting with the installation on the TV. The obstacle will be the Instagram images that being upload by the public via a certain hashtag (#). The looks of the Instagram images will be in a Polaroid film kind of framing and the will keep on popping across the TV screen thus blocking the audience to see the image of themselves at the TV. This does create a situation of the audience where they need to make a decision where they need to sacrifices their Instagram upload to see better of themselves or keep on uploading thus blocking the reflection of themselves with the Instagram Polaroid images.

## ***Hardware Requirement (Not Complete)**: 
The stage in terms of hardware items will consist of a large tv and the in front of the audience, a webcam on top of the tv, a computer that connected with the tv.

The tv will be displaying the outcome view of the webcam. The camera will be directly pointed towards the audience so that they can see themselves at the tv and act as a mirror. The tv will be framed with a cardboard or the virtual Instagram logo, or the lens-vector looks with the lens in the middle being cut and able to project the audience face or body through it.

**### ## Technology devices and Method**

An Interactive installation will be used in the final year project of Media Arts and Design as the method of execution. The outcome of the project will be the stage of interactive installation being play with the audience. 
There will be some obstacle appears while the audience interacting with the installation on the tv. The obstacle will be the Instagram images that being upload by the public via a certain hashtag (#). The looks of the Instagram images will be in a polaroid film kind of framing and the will keep on popping across the tv screen thus blocking the audience to see the image of themselves at the tv. This does create a situation of the audience where they need to make a decision where they need to sacrifices their Instagram upload to see better of themselves or keep on uploading thus blocking the reflection of themselves with the Instagram polaroid images.
In order to make this project, some technology devices and method are needed to accomplish this project successfully. Below are the method and devices that will be needed.

**_Camera Tracking_**

This method is involving of using minimum of webcam or high-end video camera. It needed to be connected with the computer and with the projector. So, what is camera tracking? Camera Tracking is a process which involves taking a post that has been filmed with a real live camera and tracking its motion so that 3d elements can be added to it.
This process is used countless times throughout movies and tv shows to add special effects, backdrops, robots, you name it. A perfect example is the Transformers 3 trailer. Anytime there's a moving camera shot, and there's a cg element, camera tracking has been used.
By using camera tracking that embodied with webcam, the audiences able to see themselves and the artist able to track the movement of the audiences and apply any kind of effects or particle around or on top of the displayed vision of the audience.

**_Projection Mapping_**

Projection Mapping uses everyday video projectors, but instead of projecting on a flat screen (e.g. to display a PowerPoint), light is mapped onto any surface, turning common objects of any 3D shape into interactive displays. More formally, projection mapping is ‚Äúthe display of an image on a non-flat or non-white surface‚Äù.
Projection mapping has many alternate names including the original academic term ‚Äúspatial augmented reality‚Äù and ‚Äúvideo mapping.‚Äù It can be used for advertising, live concerts, theatre, gaming, computing, decoration and anything else you can think of. Specialized software or just some elbow grease can be used to align the virtual content and the physical objects. For more information see our Software sections. 
The basic method of projection mapping will be involving the usage of normal projector and mapping it on a white cloth or projector screen. The projector will be connected with the computer to unable the artist displays the visualization or project to the audience. 

_**Database of a server**_

A database is a data structure that stores organized information. Most databases contain multiple tables, which may each include several different fields. For example, a company database may include tables for products, employees, and financial records. Each of these tables would have different fields that are relevant to the information stored in the table.  The database is needed for the artist to interact with the social media platform of creating a social media based of interactive installation. For example, if the artist need to use a certain hashtag (#) on Instagram as the interaction part of their installation, the artist need to access the database of the Instagram and grab a certain information (hashtag (#)) and use it as a triggered button to active the installation. This will be involving the connection of user database with the other database knowledge.

Touch Screen Interface (UBI INTERFACE)
A touch screen is a computer display screen that is also an input device. The screens are sensitive to pressure; a user interacts with the computer by touching pictures or words on the screen.
Using a device that able to detected motion and distance of a person with the projected screen, it will enable the audience to control the interactive installation physically. It will able to set a vibe of interaction between human and the machine and thus making the installation more interesting.

_**Processing**_

Processing is an open source computer programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks.

_**HTC VIVE**_

The Vive Developer Edition uses two 1200 x 1080 displays that refresh at 90 frames per second, "eliminating jitter" and achieving "photorealistic imagery," according to HTC. The displays are said to envelope your entire field of vision with 360-degree views. The company says in a press release that it's the first device to offer a "full room-scale" experience, "letting you get up, walk around and explore your virtual space, inspect objects from every angle and truly interact with your surroundings."
